      <h3>What is COVID-19?</h3>
      <br />
      <p class="para1">
        COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people
        with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely
        ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of
        illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID
        conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health
        problems people can experience more than four weeks after first being
        infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who
        have certain underlying medical conditions are more likely to get
        severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and
        effective.
      </p>

      <h3>Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect myself?</h3>
      <br />
      <p class="para2">
        Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family
        from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at
        least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or
        sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If
        soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand
        sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?</h3>
      <br />
      <p class="para3">
        People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms â€“ from mild
        symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure
        to the virus. If you have fever, cough, or other symptoms, you might
        have COVID-19
